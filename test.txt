 Career Fair
 Memo
At the career fair, I spoke to a number of companies and recruiters, the most memorable of which were 
Brad Gilchrist 
of 
Weyerhaeuser
, 
Brad Hicks
 of 
Knight Transportation
, and 
Joe Vaughn
 of
 Tenstreet
, who all were helpful, informative, and upbeat.
At the career fair, I learned 
about the necessity of having both generic questions prepared, and having the ability to come up with questions 
on the spot, as well as how flexible one needs to be
, 
both with respect to the jobs you are willing to take and with what your degree could permit you to do.
To prepare for 
my next career fair, 
I would group up with other students of similar majors, interests, and skills 
to increase coverage
 and brainstorm questions
 for recruiters
, rather than working independently
.
 I would also expand my reading and preparation to all of the companies present at the fair, rather than just the ones I am most interested in.
The career fair could stand for some improvement; having a map of the precise locations of each companyâ€™s tables would be useful
, along with the ability for companies to show up virtually (perhaps presenting a list of QR codes that check in with the company on Handshake
 and redirect to their recruiting sites
)
, so that more companies can attend, at lower costs
.
Regards,
Chris Bayless
